# Linear-Perceptron-Classifier
This is a Linear Perceptron Classifier. 

This is a very basic perceptron classifier that takes in 2 features from a CSV file whose first and second columns are features and third is corresponding labels. And then uses a supervised learning model to define an equation of the best fit line. And then predicts a label from the features that you give in the end as inputs.

The Code is written entirely in python without using any additional machine learning libraries.
The only used libraries are random and csv library
